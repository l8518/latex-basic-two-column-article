# latex-basic-two-column-article
This is yet another LaTeX template - slim, easy and only with a few packages.

I appreciate that a lot of LaTeX templates are available on the Internet (i.e., Overleaf). However, most of them are bulky, full of package-dependencies and so on, and I wanted to have a simple template I could adapt very quickly.

This is a very simple template anyone could adapt. Feel free to use it yourself.
